    <h3>Development of a Mobile Application for Transportation Booking</h3>
    <p>
      As part of the final project for the Software Engineering course, my team and I developed <strong>Jekwave</strong>, a mobile application for transportation booking. The project started with requirement engineering to create a detailed and user-oriented system specification.
      Jekwave is designed to provide ease, comfort, and safety for users when booking transportation, addressing the needs of modern society. The development process included phases of analysis, system design, and implementation planning, resulting in a practical and efficient solution.
